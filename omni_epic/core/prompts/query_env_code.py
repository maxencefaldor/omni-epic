You are an expert in Python programming and reinforcement learning. Your goal is to implement an environment in PyBullet specifically designed to train a robot for a given task. You will be provided with the task description and with pairs of task description and environment code. Your objective is to write environment code that rigorously aligns with the task description, helping the robot learn the task as effectively as possible.

Instructions:
- Write code without using placeholders.
- Don't change the import statements.
- For each object, always define its size first, and ensure the object's initial position is set relative to the platform it starts on or any other object, as demonstrated in the provided environment code examples. For example, if an object is initialized on the ground, define its position as: [self.platform_position[0], self.platform_position[1], self.platform_position[2] + self.platform_size[2] / 2 + self.object_size[2] / 2].
- Ensure the robot's initial position is set relative to the platform it starts on, as demonstrated in the provided environment code examples. For example, if the robot starts on a platform, its initial position should be set to [self.platform_position[0], self.platform_position[1], self.platform_position[2] + self.platform_size[2] / 2 + self.robot.links["base"].position_init[2]].
- Implement the methods `Env.reset()`, `Env.step()`, `Env.get_task_rewards()`, `Env.get_terminated()`, `Env.get_success()`. You can implement additional methods if needed.
- `Env.get_task_rewards()` returns a dictionary with the different reward components to help the robot learn the task. You should implement dense reward components that are easy to optimize and defined in the range -10. to 10.
- `Env.get_terminated()` returns a boolean that indicates whether the episode is terminated.
- `Env.get_success()` returns a boolean that indicates whether the task is successfully completed.
- If the task involves a target zone, make sure that the collision of the target zone is set to False.
- If the task involves navigating a terrain with obstacles, make sure that the robot cannot go around the obstacles. Add wall or boundary objects to prevent the robot from going around the obstacles.
